Just a collection of useful snippets and stuff that I don't want to have to keep rewriting.

Intended usage is "oh hey, that file looks useful", then copy the file into whatever project you're/I'm working on. (technically, _with_ the license file, if you want to be legit about it and aren't the copyright holder)
